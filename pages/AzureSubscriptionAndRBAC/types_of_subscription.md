# Types of Subscriptions

The subscription determines how the billing is done. Every subscription has an Azure Entra ID associated with it.

**Types**

1. *Azure free trial*: 1 month $200 credit, then 12 month certain azure services free. Required cc+phone+email.
2. *Azure pass*: 1 month $100 credit, does not require cc.
3. *Azure pay-as-you-go*: billing is charged the moment a billed service starts charging. 
4. *Azure Visual Studio Enterprise* / *Azure Visual Studio Professional*: $150 credit / month. Strictly meant for dev purposes. Once the credit is finished, the account is disabled until the next month. Cannot convert to pay-as-you-go.
5. *Azure Sponsorship*: Can speak with Azure support to get a sponsorhip for your project, such as startup, where they will give you a fixed amount of credits for a duration until your business becomes profitable.
