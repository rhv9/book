# Custom domain name and TLS

We can add custom domains for the URL of web application. The custom domain can be obtained with a 12$ fee per year (not sure if it applies to all domain names) with Azure's own domain name services.

Alternatively, we can also configure custom domain name that is purchased from third parties like GoDaddy.

> I don't understand how this works but there is some exchange of CNAME and keys to fully register it to Azure.

Once it is setup correctly, in portal we can see a validation tick mark if it is working.
