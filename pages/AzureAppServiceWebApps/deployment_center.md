# Deployment Center

In deployment center, we can configure how we deploy the web application to the app service. 

There are the following options:

1. Github
2. Bitbucket
3. Azure Git Repo
4. Local Git

Here, we can configure CI/CD for each option. So for Github, we can configure the Github Actions for deployment.
