# NAT Gateway

NAT Gateway is a service that allows you to give internet access to any subnet. 

Simply create an NAT Gateway with public IP address and then within subnet in VNet configuration, you can attach an NAT Gateway directly, and then it has internet access. 

## Cost

There is a fixed running cost/hour. At the time of writing, it costs roughly $32/month to simply run. But that is not the only cost.

Then there is data transferred cost/GB. About 23GiB costs $1 roughly.
