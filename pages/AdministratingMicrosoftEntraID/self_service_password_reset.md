# Self Service Password Reset

First thing to understand is the difference between change password and reset password. Change password is about changing your password after you are already *authenticated and authorised* to do so (logged in). Whereas reset password is about not being able authenticate who you are based on password and need to reset it.

Self service password reset is by default disabled. We can enable for all users or even select who are allowed to do so.

When registering security questions, you can select to register a certain amount and also choose how many questions they must answer to accept.

## Registration

Can select if users are required to register their other factors of authentication on initial login.

You can also set the days before the user is asked to reconfirm their authentication.
