# Azure Blueprint

Azure Blueprint is a service where you can draft, store and assign blueprints that will create the set of resources and assignments configured. 

What makes Azure Blueprint more than ARM templates is that for each blueprint, you can add the following:

- Resource Groups: create resource groups
- Role assignment
- Policy assignment
- ARM templates

Assign blueprints at different managment group levels or subscriptions.
