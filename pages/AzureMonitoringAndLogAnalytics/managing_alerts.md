# Managing Alerts

For every Activity Log and Metric data, we can create an Alert rule to perform an action based on such events.

For every alert rule, we need an Action Group to notify of the alert. Eact alert can have up to 5 Action Groups.


## Cost

Alert rules for activity logs are free.

Alert rules for ***Metric*** and ***Diagnostic Settings*** data have a cost per alert (learning material showed $0.10).

#### Action Group

An action group is a set of different actions to feed an alert to. There are two types of actions we can configure:

1. Notification: These include email, SMS, voice.
    - Configure a rule per email, ...

2. Action: Adding actions including: Runbook, Secure Webhook, Webhook, Function, LogicApp, ITSM
